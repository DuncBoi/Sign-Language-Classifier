# Sign Language Classifier
**Author**: Duncan Greene

This is a Sign Language Classifier implemented in Python for **COMS 4701 - Artificial Intelligence** at Columbia University
## Overview
- This project involved training a *Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)* using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to model a classifier for sign language recognition. The training and testing data is provided in `train.csv` and `test.csv` in [this google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1DxbyfpckcII5Q0dSBKzoboiArjtE4lKz).
- Each data point is a 28 x 28 pixel greyscale image of a hand, an example of which can be seen below:
